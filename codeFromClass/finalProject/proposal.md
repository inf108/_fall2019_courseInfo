# Final Project Proposal: Daleks
---
My project will include a drawing of a Dalek (from Dr. Who) that moves
across the screen. This is a substantive project because there are many
things I can add to the drawing that will add value: a TARDIS, landscape,
stars in the sky, etc. I can keep adding features to the drawing as time
permits.

Most of what I need for this project is straight from the course. I will
use the graphics.py library for drawing. I plan to use time.sleep() to
make pauses between animation frames. If that doesn't work, I will find 
another library or have the picture be unanimated.
